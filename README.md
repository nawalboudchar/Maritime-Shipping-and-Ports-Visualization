In maritime sector there are so many measures to describe a country's integration into global shipping network, as well performance across different ports.

This project is about creating several visualization related to some shipping and port activity indicators such as port calls, Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (LSCI), Port Liner Shipping Connectivity Index (PLSCI), and Container port throughput.
